`When you’re dying you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black Gates of Death’s Kingdom (the GM will describe it).
Then roll (just roll, +nothing — yeah, Death doesn’t care how tough or cool you are).
* On a 10+, you’ve cheated Death — you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive.
* On a 7–9, Death himself will offer you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you.
* On 6-, your fate is sealed. You’re marked as Death’s own and you’ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.`
